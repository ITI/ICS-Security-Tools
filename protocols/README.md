It can be compiled on Linux and Windows platforms. It's possible to poll and view data from the substation system (RTU/concentrator) and also send commands.
* [lib60870](https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870) - Implements IEC 60870-5-104 protocol.

## IEC 61850
### Protocol Implementation
* [libIEC61850](http://libiec61850.com/libiec61850/) - open source library for IEC 61850.
* [rapid61850](https://github.com/stevenblair/rapid61850) - Rapid-prototyping protection and control schemes with IEC 61850

### Tools
* [IEDScout](https://www.omicronenergy.com/en/products/all/secondary-testing-calibration/iedscout/noc/1/) - IEDScout provides access to 61850-based IEDs and can simulate entire Ed. {1,2} IEDs. Specifically, IEDScout lets you look inside the IED and at its communication. All data modeled and exchanged becomes visible and accessible. Additionally, IEDScout serves numerous useful tasks, which could otherwise only be performed with dedicated engineering tools or even a functioning master station. IEDScout shows an overview representing the typical workflow of commissioning, but also provides detailed information upon request. **[commercial]** Free 30 day evaluation license.

## Modbus
### Protocol Implementation
* [pyModBus](https://github.com/bashwork/pymodbus) - A full modbus protocol written in python.
* [ Modbus for Go](https://github.com/goburrow/modbus) - Fault-tolerant implementation of modbus protocol in Go (golang)
* [ModbusPal](http://modbuspal.sourceforge.net) - ModbusPal is a MODBUS slave simulator. Its purpose is to offer an easy to use interface with the capabilities to reproduce complex and realistic MODBUS environments. Mirror available [here](../tools/mirrored/modbuspal/).
* [SMOD](https://github.com/enddo/smod) - MODBUS Penetration Testing Framework. smod is a modular framework with every kind of diagnostic and offensive feature you could need in order to pentest modbus protocol. It is a full Modbus protocol implementation using Python and Scapy. This software could be run on Linux/OSX under python 2.7.x.

### Fuzzing
* [AEGIS Fuzzer](https://www.automatak.com/aegis/) - Aegis™ is a smart fuzzing framework for a growing number of protocols that can identify robustness and security issues in communications software before it is deployed in a production system. **[commercial]** Early Open Source version is mirrored here: [Open-Source](aegis-opensource).

## PROFINET
### Protocol Implementation
* [Profinet - Python](https://github.com/devkid/profinet) - Simple PROFINET implementation in python
* [Profinet - C](https://github.com/kprovost/libs7comm) - PROFINET implementation in C
* [Profinet Explorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/profinetexplorer/) - Simple PROFINET explorer written in C#

### Fuzzing
* [ProFuzz](https://github.com/HSASec/ProFuzz) - Simple PROFINET fuzzer based on Scapy

## Siemens S7
* [Snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/) - open source Siemens S7 communication library.
* [LibNoDave](http://libnodave.sourceforge.net/) - Another (less complete) open source communication library for the S7 protocol.

## Zigbee
* [Killerbee](https://github.com/riverloopsec/killerbee) - IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee Security Research Toolkit.

## Ethernet/IP and CIP
* [EtherNet/IP+CIP dissector for Scapy](https://github.com/scy-phy/scapy-cip-enip) - a Python library which can be used to interact with components of a network using ENIP (Ethernet/IP) and CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) protocols. It uses scapy to implement packet dissectors which are able to decode a part of the network traffic. These dissectors can also be used to craft packets, which allows directly communicating with the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) of the network. [Use case](https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/offensive-ics-exploitation-a-technical-description/)

## General Protocol Fuzzing
* [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) - American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted binary.

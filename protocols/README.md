## Ethernet/IP and CIP
* [EtherNet/IP+CIP dissector for Scapy](https://github.com/scy-phy/scapy-cip-enip) - a Python library which can be used to interact with components of a network using ENIP (Ethernet/IP) and CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) protocols. It uses scapy to implement packet dissectors which are able to decode a part of the network traffic. These dissectors can also be used to craft packets, which allows directly communicating with the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) of the network. [Use case](https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/offensive-ics-exploitation-a-technical-description/)

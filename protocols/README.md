# ICS Protocols 
## Developed as a community asset at S4x16

## Modbus
### Protocol Implementation
* [pyModBus](https://github.com/bashwork/pymodbus) - A full modbus protocol written in python.

* [ Modbus for Go](https://github.com/goburrow/modbus) - Fault-tolerant implementation of modbus protocol in Go (golang)

### Fuzzing
* [AEGIS Fuzzer](https://www.automatak.com/aegis/) - Aegis™ is a smart fuzzing framework for a growing number of protocols that can identify robustness and security issues in communications software before it is deployed in a production system.

* [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) - American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted binary.

## DNP3
### Protocol Implementation
* [OpenDNP3](https://github.com/automatak/dnp3) - Opendnp3 is the de facto reference implementation of IEEE-1815 (DNP3) provided under the Apache License.
* [DNP3 Simulator](https://github.com/automatak/dnp3-simulator) - Graphical DNP3 Master/Outstation simulator
* [PIFaceRTU](https://github.com/automatak/pifacertu) - Opendnp3 running on a Raspberry Pi with Piface I/O board
* [Langsec DNP3 Parser](https://github.com/pesco/dnp3) - Parsing DNP3 using parser combinators in C.

### Fuzzing
* [AEGIS Fuzzer](https://www.automatak.com/aegis/) - Aegis™ is a smart fuzzing framework for a growing number of protocols that can identify robustness and security issues in communications software before it is deployed in a production system.

## 61850
### Protocol Implementation
* [libIEC61850](http://libiec61850.com/libiec61850/) - open source library for IEC 61850.
* [rapid61850](https://github.com/stevenblair/rapid61850) - Rapid-prototyping protection and control schemes with IEC 61850

### Network
* [GRASSMARLIN] (https://github.com/iadgov/GRASSMARLIN) - GRASSMARLIN provides IP network situational awareness of industrial control systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks to support network security. Passively map, and visually display, an ICS/SCADA network topology while safely conducting device discovery, accounting, and reporting on these critical cyber-physical systems.

### Protocols
* [TruffleHog](https://github.com/TruffleHog/TruffleHog) - A network analysis tool that works together with snort to visually represent a PROFINET network graph.

## Analysis
### Logs
* [Plaso - Log2timeline](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki) - log2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found on a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.

### Malware
* [YARA](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/) - YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.
* [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) - The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
* [OPC Data Access IDAPython script](https://github.com/eset/malware-research/tree/master/industroyer) - An IDAPython script for IDA Pro that helps reverse engineer binaries that are using the OPC Data Access protocol. It can be used to analyse such malware families as Havex RAT and Win32/Industroyer.

### Vulnerabilities
* [Binwalk](https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk) - Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images.

### Network
* [GRASSMARLIN] (https://github.com/iadgov/GRASSMARLIN) - GRASSMARLIN provides IP network situational awareness of industrial control systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks to support network security. Passively map, and visually display, an ICS/SCADA network topology while safely conducting device discovery, accounting, and reporting on these critical cyber-physical systems.

### Protocols
* [TruffleHog](https://github.com/TruffleHog/TruffleHog) - A network analysis tool that works together with snort to visually represent a PROFINET network graph.

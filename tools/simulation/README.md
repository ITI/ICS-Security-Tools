## Grid Simulation Tools

- [DiTTo](https://github.com/NREL/ditto) - DiTTo is a Distribution Transformation Tool that aims at providing an open source framework to convert various distribution systems modeling formats.
- [GridDyn](https://github.com/llnl/griddyn) - is an open-source power transmission simulation software package developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The name is a concatenation of Grid Dynamics, and as such usually pronounced as "Grid Dine". It was created to meet a research need for exploring coupling between transmission, distribution, and communications system simulations.
- [GridLab-D](http://www.gridlabd.org) - GridLAB-D™ is a new power distribution system simulation and analysis tool that provides valuable information to users who design and operate distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the latest energy technologies. It incorporates the most advanced modeling techniques, with high-performance algorithms to deliver the best in end-use modeling. GridLAB-D™ is coupled with distribution automation models and software integration tools for users of many power system analysis tools. Source code [here](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d)
- [MatDyn](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/electa/teaching/matdyn/) - MatDyn is a free Matlab based open source program to perform dynamic analysis of electric power systems, inspired by Matpower.
- [matpower](https://matpower.org) - Free, open-source tools for electric power system simulation and optimization
- [OMF](https://github.com/dpinney/omf) - The Open Modeling Framework for smart grid cost-benefit analysis. Open Modeling Framework (OMF) is a set of Python libraries for simulating power systems behavior with an emphasis on cost-benefit analysis of emerging technologies: distributed generation, storage, networked controls, etc.
- [OpenDSS](http://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) - The OpenDSS is a comprehensive electrical power system simulation tool primarily for electric utility power distribution systems. It supports nearly all frequency domain (sinusoidal steady‐state) analyses commonly performed on electric utility power distribution systems.
- [pandapower](http://www.pandapower.org) - An easy to use open source tool for power system modeling, analysis and optimization with a high degree of automation.
- [PowerWorld Simulator](http://www.powerworld.com) - PowerWorld Simulator is an interactive power system simulation package designed to simulate high voltage power system operation on a time frame ranging from several minutes to several days. The software contains a highly effective power flow analysis package capable of efficiently solving systems of up to 250,000 buses. **[Commercial, Free for educational use.]**
- [PSLF](http://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf) - Effective power system analysis often requires large-scale simulations and manipulation of large volumes of data. When performing these analyses, efficient algorithms are just as important as the engineering models in which the data is used. GE Energy recognizes these imperatives, and has developed Concorda PSLF. The algorithms in the PSLF suite have been developed to handle large utility-scale systems of up to 80,000 buses. A complete set of tools allows the user to switch smoothly between data visualization, system simulation, and results analysis. **[Commercial]**
- [pypower](https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER) - PYPOWER is a power flow and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solver. It is a port of MATPOWER to the Python programming language. Current features include: DC and AC (Newton’s method & Fast Decoupled) power flow and DC and AC optimal power flow (OPF)
- [Siemens PSSE](http://w3.siemens.com/smartgrid/global/en/products-systems-solutions/software-solutions/planning-data-management-software/planning-simulation/pages/pss-e.aspx) - PSS®E is a trusted leader in the power industry for cutting-edge electric transmission system analysis and planning. Used in over 115 countries worldwide, PSS®E is powerful, customizable, and fully-featured. With the addition of integrated node-breaker support in version 34, PSS®E is leading the market in advances in electric transmission modeling and simulation. **[Commercial]**
- [SoftGrid](https://github.com/smartgridadsc/SoftGrid) - SoftGrid: A Testing Toolkit for Evaluating Power Grid Substation Cybersecurity Solutions.

## Libraries to Interface with Simulators

- [oct2pypower](https://github.com/rwl/oct2pypower) - Python bridge to MATPOWER using Oct2Py.
- [PyPSSE](https://github.com/NREL/PyPSSE) - A python wrapper around psspy (python API for PSSE simulator) to perform time series powerflow and dynamic simulation for power system fault.
- [PyDSS](https://github.com/NREL/PyDSS) - PyDSS is a high level python interface for OpenDSS and provides the following functionalities.

## Nuclear Power Plant Simulation Tools

## Federation Tooling

- [HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS) - Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation (HELICS). HELICS provides an open-source, general-purpose, modular, highly-scalable co-simulation framework that runs cross-platform (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X). It is not a modeling tool by itself, but rather an integration tool that enables multiple existing simulation tools (and/or multiple instances of the same tool), known as "federates," to exchange data during runtime and stay synchronized in time such that together they act as one large simulation, or "federation".
- [mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de) - Mosaik allows you to reuse and combine existing simulation models and simulators to create large-scale Smart Grid scenarios.

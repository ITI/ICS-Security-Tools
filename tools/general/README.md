# ICS Tools - General

Developed as a community asset

## General

- [AdvancedHMI](http://www.advancedhmi.com) - AdvancedHMI allows you to create HMI's. The software is based on the .NET framework and uses the popular Visual Studio as it's designer.
- [Eclipse NeoSCADA](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipsescada/) - Designed to be a framework to create a fully working production SCADA System. This was formerly called openSCADA.
- [IGSS Free 50](http://igss.schneider-electric.com/products/igss/download/free-scada.aspx) - IGSS FREE50 is a free edition of IGSS V11 (released May 2014) that is a full-featured SCADA System. Same functionality as the full offering, but is limited to setting up a project with no more than 50 objects.
- [IndigoSCADA](http://www.enscada.com/a7khg9/IndigoSCADA.html) - A small footprint DCS - SCADA running on Linux and Windows. Development environment C/C++. HMI is based on QT library. Different technologies (EiC, GigaBASE, FastDB) have been integrated. OPC DA 2.05a, AE 1.10, HDA 1.20, DNP 3.0, RFC 1006, Modbus are supported.
- [ioBroker](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker) - ioBroker is an IoT platform that is modular and supports some ICS protocols such as [s7](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.s7), [modbus](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.modbus).
- [OPCSystems.Net](https://www.opcsystems.com/downloads/downloads.php) - A wide variety of software available for time-limited trial use. SCADA, HMI, and OPC broadly covered.
- [OpenSCADA (oscada)](http://oscada.org/main/) - OpenSCADA system is an open implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) systems. The main properties of the system are: openness(GPL), multi-platform, modularity and scalability.
- [OSHMI - Open Substation HMI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oshmiopensubstationhmi/) - Full featured HMI used in production substations (Brazil).
- [promotic](https://www.promotic.eu/en/index.htm) - a software tool used for visualization and control of technological processes in a wide spectrum of industrial branches.
- [pvbrowser](https://github.com/pvbrowser/pvb) - Simple process visualization
- [PySCADA](https://github.com/trombastic/PyScada) - A Open Source SCADA System with HTML5 HMI, build using the Django framework.
- [RapidSCADA](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada) - Rapid SCADA is an open-source full featured SCADA software that supports MODBUS and OPC.
- [ScadaBR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scadabr/) - ScadaBR is a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system with applications in Process Control and Automation, being developed and distributed using the open source model.
- [SCADA-LTS](https://github.com/SCADA-LTS/Scada-LTS) - Actively maintained fork of ScadaBR

## Education Kits and Distributions

- [CybatiWorks](https://cybati.org/cybatiworks-one) - Control system cybersecurity platform enabling entities to understand control system environments and cybersecurity risks. Engages the participant in understanding, enumerating, penetrating and mitigating the engineering workstation, HMI, OPC, Historian, PLC/PAC/IED/R(M)TU/DCS and protocol communications. Made up of three key components, 1) Virtualized operating system providing cyber offensive and defensive capabilities for ICS and IT environments, 2) Leveraging the Raspberry PI with PiFace Digital to represent a variety of control system devices (e.g. PLCs, PACs, MTU/RTU, DCS, Physical Security, and 3) Low voltage, kinetic I/O supporting models such as a traffic light, water treatment facility, bottling plant and assembly line.
- [ControlThings.io](https://www.controlthings.io) - ControlThings Platform takes the best-in-breed security assessment tools for traditional IT infrastructures and adds specialized tools for embedded electronics, proprietary wireless, and a healthy dose of ICS specific assessment tools, both from the greater community and custom created from their team. This is used in some training curriculum as well.
- [LICSTER](https://github.com/hsainnos/LICSTER) - LICSTER, the Low-cost ICS Security Testbed for Education and Research, aims to help setup a minimal, low-cost Industrial Control System (ICS) testbed for students, researchers, or anyone with an interest in industrial security. The project contains a list of affordable hardware to build the minimalistic ICS with, instructions, configurations and installation scripts to instantiate the system as well as various attacker scenarios and their implications.

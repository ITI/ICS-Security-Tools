- [OpenSCADA (oscada)](http://oscada.org/main/) - OpenSCADA system is an open implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) systems. The main properties of the system are: openness(GPL), multi-platform, modularity and scalability.
- [OSHMI - Open Substation HMI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oshmiopensubstationhmi/) - Full featured HMI used in production substations (Brazil).
- [promotic](https://www.promotic.eu/en/index.htm) - a software tool used for visualization and control of technological processes in a wide spectrum of industrial branches.
- [pvbrowser](https://github.com/pvbrowser/pvb) - Simple process visualization
- [PySCADA](https://github.com/trombastic/PyScada) - A Open Source SCADA System with HTML5 HMI, build using the Django framework.
- [RapidSCADA](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada) - Rapid SCADA is an open-source full featured SCADA software that supports MODBUS and OPC.
- [ScadaBR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scadabr/) - ScadaBR is a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system with applications in Process Control and Automation, being developed and distributed using the open source model.
- [SCADA-LTS](https://github.com/SCADA-LTS/Scada-LTS) - Actively maintained fork of ScadaBR
- [ElectricPY](https://github.com/engineerjoe440/ElectricPy) - Python Libraries with functions and constants related to electrical engineering.

## Education Kits and Distributions

- [CybatiWorks](https://cybati.org/cybatiworks-one) - Control system cybersecurity platform enabling entities to understand control system environments and cybersecurity risks. Engages the participant in understanding, enumerating, penetrating and mitigating the engineering workstation, HMI, OPC, Historian, PLC/PAC/IED/R(M)TU/DCS and protocol communications. Made up of three key components, 1) Virtualized operating system providing cyber offensive and defensive capabilities for ICS and IT environments, 2) Leveraging the Raspberry PI with PiFace Digital to represent a variety of control system devices (e.g. PLCs, PACs, MTU/RTU, DCS, Physical Security, and 3) Low voltage, kinetic I/O supporting models such as a traffic light, water treatment facility, bottling plant and assembly line.
- [CyphyOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyphy/) - Debian 10 x86_64 Based Distro Flavor, specifically for Cyber Physical System penetration testing. Powered with XFCE4. Out-Of-The-Box Dedicated to All Hardware Hackers. Especially for those who are still using the common pentesting tools and in need of hardware, Embedded System, IoT and SCADA tools as well. Also SDR tools are in place and configurations are made for HackRF, RTL-SDR and BladeRF.
- [ControlThings.io](https://www.controlthings.io) - ControlThings Platform takes the best-in-breed security assessment tools for traditional IT infrastructures and adds specialized tools for embedded electronics, proprietary wireless, and a healthy dose of ICS specific assessment tools, both from the greater community and custom created from their team. This is used in some training curriculum as well.
- [LICSTER](https://github.com/hsainnos/LICSTER) - LICSTER, the Low-cost ICS Security Testbed for Education and Research, aims to help setup a minimal, low-cost Industrial Control System (ICS) testbed for students, researchers, or anyone with an interest in industrial security. The project contains a list of affordable hardware to build the minimalistic ICS with, instructions, configurations and installation scripts to instantiate the system as well as various attacker scenarios and their implications. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00303).

# ICS Testbed Tooling

Developed as a community asset

## Platforms

- [melody](https://github.com/iti/melody) - a TestBed which integrates Power System Simulation with Mininet to simulate a Micro Grid control Architecture. This TestBed was used for Anomaly Detection Purposes.
- [NREL CEE](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/74142.pdf) - NRELâ€™s Cyber-Energy Emulation Platform for Research and System Visualization built upon Minimega and SCEPTRE.
- [SCEPTRE](https://www.sandia.gov/app/uploads/sites/122/2021/09/SCEPTRE_SAND2019-11907M.pdf) - Sandia National Labs SCEPTRE provides a cyber-physical environment to analyze how cyber-initiated events affect the physical world. Over-arching effort for minimega, phenix, and various plugins.
- [minimega](https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega) - minimega is a tool for launching and managing virtual machines.
- [phenix](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix) - phenix is an orchestration tool and GUI for Sandia's minimega platform
- [phenix-apps](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix-apps) - Apps written to work with the latest version of phenix 
- [phenix-images](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix-images) - phenix image is a tool for quickly creating vm images with debian-based OSes
- [phenix-topologies](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix-topologies) - Topologies created to work with the latest version of phenix 
- [sceptre-bennu](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-bennu) - Modeling and simulation application for ICS.
- [OT-sim](https://github.com/patsec/ot-sim) - A set of modules that run simulated OT devices in VMs or containers, allowing researchers to represent a physical system, at scale, in a co-simulation environment for specific or system-wide testing and evaluation without impacting a real-world system.


## Systems
- [ICS TestBed Framework](https://github.com/PMaynard/ICS-TestBed-Framework) - A scalable framework for automatically deploying locally (or remotely) a number of virtual machines that replicate a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) network is proposed.
- [GRFICS](https://github.com/djformby/GRFICS) - GRFICS is a graphical realism framework for industrial control simulations that uses Unity 3D game engine graphics to lower the barrier to entry for industrial control system security. GRFICS provides users with a full virtual industrial control system (ICS) network to practice common attacks including command injection, man-in-the-middle, and buffer overflows, and visually see the impact of their attacks in the 3D visualization. Users can also practice their defensive skills by properly segmenting the network with strong firewall rules, or writing intrusion detection rules.
- [GRFICS v2](https://github.com/Fortiphyd/GRFICSv2) - GRFICS v2 is version 2 of the above package, organized as 5 Virtualbox VMs. There is also a commercial version of this now available.
- [MiniCPS](https://github.com/scy-phy/minicps) - MiniCPS: a framework for Cyber-Physical Systems real-time simulation, built on top of mininet.- [Oil Pumpjack](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/oil-pumpjack) - Cisco-Talos repository contains all the materials to create your own oil pumpjack environment.
- [TESP](https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/) - PNNL's Transactive Energy Simulation Platform (TESP). The intended use case for TESP is to focus on the development and testing of transactive control agents, without having to build up a large system simulation infrastructure
- [DVCP-TE](https://github.com/satejnik/DVCP-TE) - Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process - Tennessee Eastman
- [DVCP-VAM](https://github.com/satejnik/DVCP-VAM) - Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process - Vinyl Acetate Monomer
- [SWaT Simulator](https://github.com/yuqiChen94/Swat_Simulator) - SUTD SWaT Testbed Simulation written in python
- [Simple Process Simulation](https://github.com/arnaudsoullie/simple-process-simulation) - HTML/JS process simulation interacting with a modbus device, by Arnaud Soullie
- [ICSSIM](https://github.com/AlirezaDehlaghi/ICSSIM) - A Framework for Building Industrial Control Systems Security Simulation Testbeds, [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13325)
- [Sandia Experiment Control System](https://github.com/sandialabs/ECS) - The purpose of the Sandia Experimental Control System (ECS) is to provide a holistic cyber-physical environment for experiments on the response of organizations and their personnel to cyber-physical blended attacks.
- [Railway [Metro] IT/OT System Cyber Security Test Platform (Mini cyber range)](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Railway_IT_OT_System_Cyber_Security_Platform) - a simplified and straightforward digital twin-style emulation platform for a railway system, simulating the operations of multiple trains on various tracks, each with distinct sensor-signal controls. This platform serves as a cyber range for cyber security researchers to showcase and test the impact of various IT attacks on OT systems.


## Survey

- [Industrial Control Systems Testbed Survey](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/projects/ics_survey/) - This page aims to collect and share the current state of the art Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Testbed and Datasets developed for security research. We think that this collection can help the ICS security community see the current research trend worldwide and find useful information to support future studies.

## Auditing
* [Bandolier Security Audit Files](http://www.digitalbond.com/tools/bandolier/) - These audit files are used with the Nessus scanner’s compliance plugins to audit the security settings of control system components. A typical control system will have over 1,000 security settings including the OS settings, database and webserver settings, and the SCADA or DCS application settings. Digital Bond worked with the vendors, such as ABB, AREVA, Emerson, OSIsoft, Telvent, …, to identify the optimal security settings for their systems. Bandolier Security Audit Files are very useful at FAT to insure the system is installed in an optimal security configuration and periodically to verify the configuration has not degraded.
* [Portaledge](http://www.digitalbond.com/tools/portaledge/) - The OSIsoft PI Server is an extremely popular historian that aggregates and correlates process data. In Portaledge, Digital Bond has created modules to aggregate security events and correlate these events to detect cyber attacks. There are a variety of modules including modules that meet the NERC CIP monitoring requirements.
* [Quickdraw ICS IDS](http://www.digitalbond.com/tools/quickdraw/) - Digital Bond’s original research project was to develop a set of IDS rules for SCADA protocols. The initial rules for Modbus TCP and DNP3 have now been enhanced for EtherNet/IP, Vulnerability rules and Device Specific rules. Quickdraw also includes Snort preprocessors and plugins that allow rules for more complex control system protocols.

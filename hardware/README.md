# ICS Hardware
## Developed as a community asset

## Starting Hardware
* [Siemens S7-1200](http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/programmable-logic-controller/en/basic-controller/s7-1200/pages/default.aspx) PLCs - Cheap and commonly used. You can buy a "starter kit" that includes TIA Portal (software to configure the PLC). Trial version of the software is also available. Check eBay or refurb vendors for deals.
* [MicroLogix 1100](http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Programmable-Controllers/MicroLogix-1100) - Another alternative to the S7-1200 and also available in a starter kit. Again, check eBay or refurb vendors for deals.

## Basic Lab Setup
* [Modicon Quantum](http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range/538-modicon-quantum/)
* [Koyo Direct](http://www.automationdirect.com/adc/Overview/Catalog/Programmable_Controllers/DirectLogic_Series_PLCs_(Micro_to_Small,_Brick_-a-_Modular))
* Any no-name PLC with ModBus

## Supporting Equipment

### Basic
* Network Tap or Hub for capturing network traffic
* [Throwing Star LAN Tap](https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/) - a small, simple passive Ethernet tap for monitoring Ethernet communications, requiring no power for operation.
* [BusPirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate), or equivalent
* A few USB-Ethernet dongles
* VMWare Workstation, or other virtualization software
* Several Serial Cables, and USB adapters as well if you don't have a 'real' serial port, along with wireable serial connectors from Radio Shack
* About 50 feet of networking cable with all the tools (you won't be doing
just Ethernet stuff, but its good wiring for all kinds of things)
* [NooElec SDR](http://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr.html) Dongle
* Basic Switch, 10/100 is fine for automation
* A Basic Serial to Ethernet converter (Digi, MOXA, and several others have decent products)
* Basic Multimeter (e.g., [INNOVA 3320](http://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3320-Auto-Ranging-Digital-Multimeter/dp/B000EVYGZA))
* A few 120VAC appliance replacement cords. (plug on one end and wire on the other. Lots of this equipment doesn't have standard
computer plugs, so having this makes it easy)
* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) or [BeagleBone Black](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12857) and Breadboard
* [A low-cost, DIY data diode for ICS](https://github.com/wavestone-cdt/dyode)

### Advanced
* Oscilliscope ([RIGOL](http://www.rigolna.com) are decent and cheap.)
* Universal JTAG Adapter (e.g., [Wiggler](http://www.diygadget.com/universal-jtag-adapter-v2-wiggler-and-xilinx-platform-cable-compatible-debrick-routers-modems-and-more.html), [Flyswatter 2](http://www.tincantools.com/JTAG/Flyswatter2.html), [JTAGulator](http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/jtagulator/)) and supporting software (e.g., [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org)).
* Logic Analyzer ([Saleae](https://www.saleae.com) are good for normal use, stick with an 8 channel
to start)
* Adjustable Power Supply
* [YardStickOne](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/)/[RFCat](http://int3.cc/products/rfcat)/[HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/)
* Another laptop for bare Linux
* [IDAPro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
